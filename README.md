# EmbeddedProj_Indiv

This is a menu-driven command line application. The project itself is a RC Circuit Simulator,  the program simulates the transient response of a RC circuit. It begins with a basic menu to prompt for user or file input to define component values (R, C, Vs). When the needed inputs have been entered, the program then allows the user to choose an output choice from the menu. Computing the capacitor's charging/discharging voltage over time, the output of the user's choice is then executed. The program only ends when a fatal error occurs or when the user chooses.
